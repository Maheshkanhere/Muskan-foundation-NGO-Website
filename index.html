          <div class="desc"><h2>Street To School</h2>One of the most affected victims of the pandemic are children who now have no access to schools. While a lot of children have the means for online classes, underprivileged children are still deprived of learning as they have no access to computers or smart phones. These children already have had difficult journeys, having fought the shackles of poverty, child labour, and much more to finally reach school. But the pandemic has reversed their years of struggle.</div>
